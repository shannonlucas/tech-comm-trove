# Technical communications trove

A collection of resources related to the craft of [technical communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_communication). Please note that these resources are English-centric.

I created this collection initially to support my cohort in the University of Washington [Technical Writing program](https://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/professional-technical-writing).
